## Sticky Notes Swing Java Application ## 
#The Sticky Notes application uses 6 design patterns of different types(structural, creational, behavioral)
in order to function. These pattern are used for solving some problems in the code and to keep the code as cleaner as possible.
The built in design patterns are: #

* 1. Composite - (structural pattern) It can be viewed as a tree structure made up of 
types that inherit a base type, and it can represent 
a single part or a whole hierarchy of objects.

* 2. Factory - (creational pattern) Creates an instance of several derived classes

* 3. Prototype - (creational pattern) A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

* 4. Iterator - (behavioral pattern) Sequentially access the elements of a collection

* 5. Observer - (behavioral pattern) A way of notifying change to a number of classes

* 6. State - (behavioral pattern) Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
